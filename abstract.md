# Abstract

Provide a concise summary of your proposed research of approximately 250
words. The abstract does _not_ serve as or replace the introduction; consider 
it a summary of the entire document. It makes sense to wait to write the abstract
until the rest of the document has been written. Write your abstract using
the `abstract.md` file, and the template will automatically include it.
